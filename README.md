        The recently erected Gandhi statue behind the I-Town police station replacing a four-decade-old one has a park around it,
 but the thought of arranging a staircase at the statue seemed to have not occurred to the civic authorities, and its patron, local MLA
D.A. Satyaprabha. Gandhi Jayanti on Monday brought the first occasion for the public to garland the statue since its installation.

        <h1>The TABUN HOTEL</h1>
        <br>
        The Tabun hotel is a multicuisine restaurant. This restaurant is more popular in our town; every
        one will go to this restaurant only. Why? Because in this restaurant, the taste will be nice,
        so that everyone will go to this restaurant. Beautiful Mandi biriyani experience. Multi-cuisine restaurant,
        but best for Arabian cuisine. Mandi biriyani is a must-try for anyone visiting here. The Arabian mixed
        Mandi beats them all as you get a variety of non-veg items with the biriyani. Half Mandi should be sufficient
        for 3 people and the full, for easily 6-7 people. The ambiance was brilliant, staff is well-mannered and it
        was a very different experience altogether in comparison to any other regular restaurant.
